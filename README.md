# MiddleFiddle

MiddleFiddle is an outbound local proxy which lets to modify your outbound request and responses
via [Connect](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/) middleware. It support HTTP and HTTPS, the
latter through a hijacking of the request with locally generated SSL certs.

### Installation

    npm install middlefiddle

### Examples

#### Change your user agent

Changes your outbound user-agent depending on the URL

    var Mf = require('middlefiddle');
    var iPhoneUA = "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543a Safari/419.3"
    Mf.createProxy(Mf.logger(), Mf.user_agent(iPhoneUA, /google\.com/)).listen(8088).listenHTTPS(8089);

### Add headers to a response

    var Mf = require('middlefiddle');
    var url = require('url');
    var fs = require('fs');

    var addCSP = function(urlRegex) {
      return function(req, res, next){
        if (req.fullUrl.match(urlRegex)) {
          var writeHead = res.writeHead;
          res.writeHead = function(){
            var headers = arguments[arguments.length-1];
            var statusCode = arguments[0];
            headers['x-content-security-policy'] = "allow 'self'";
            writeHead.call(res, statusCode, headers);
          };
        }
        next();
      };
    };

    Mf.createProxy(addCSP(/google.com/)).listen(8088).listenHTTPS(8089);

#### Streaming MP3 recorder

Grab any mp3 downloaded or streamed to your browser:

    var Mf = require('middlefiddle');
    var url = require('url');
    var fs = require('fs');


    var mp3Grab = function() {
      return function(req, res, next){
        var path = url.parse(req.url).pathname;
        var filename;
        if (path) {filename = path.split('/').pop()}
        if (filename && filename.match(/\.mp3$/)){
          console.log("Beginning capture of " + filename);
          var file = fs.createWriteStream(filename);
          res.addListener('data', function (chunk) {
            file.write(chunk);
          });
          res.addListener("end", function(chunk) {
            if (chunk) {
              file.write(chunk);
            }
            file = undefined;
            console.log("Downloaded - " + filename);
          });
        }
        next();
      };
    };

    Mf.createProxy(mp3Grab()).listen(8088).listenHTTPS(8089);

### HTTPS Hijacking

When an HTTPS request is first seen, MiddleFiddle generates a certificate for that domain, signs
it with it's own generated root cert, and stores the cert for future use in
~/.middlefiddle/certs

In order to make this look legit to your browser, you'll need to add the generated
root cert in ~/.middlefiddle/ca.crt to your keychain. This cert is auto generated
just for your machine, so you won't be compromising your browser security.

### Things to note

Connect typically doesn't have a simple way to hijack downstream responses, so
middlefiddle emits events on the response along with writing to the stream.

You've also got a couple helper properties:

- req.fullUrl #=> The full requested URL, including the schema
- req.isSecure #=> Did it come via SSL?

### TODO

- Expand logging
- Add more middleware

### Want to contribute

This is my first node project, criticism is gladly accepted as long as it's in
the form of a pull request.

### Development

MiddleFiddle is written in CoffeeScript. It's set
up with a Cakefile for building files in `src/` to `lib/` and running
tests with nodeunit. There's also a `docs` task that generates Docco
documentation from the source in `src/`.
